#+TITLE: Making Emacs a better tool for scholars
* Abstract                                                         :noexport:

Many scientists and humanists are beginning to believe that the best
way to ensure the longevity of their research is by using plain text
formats. Reproducible research, where code and data and published
alongside an article, is also gaining popularity. Emacs is highly
suited to implementing these solutions. I will explore ways that we
can help support scholars who use Emacs.
* Personal note
- I work for the Public Library of Science (PLOS), an open access
  science publisher
- Before that, I worked for 8 years at the California Digital Library
  at the University of California
- I‚Äôve been using GNU Emacs for 20 years üòÆ
- I expect to be using something like it for the rest of my life
- These are my personal experiences, as an Emacs user who has worked
  to support scholars and librarians
* Introduction
- Scientists and humanists need better tools: we can help them
- The needs of scholars and programmers are remarkably similar
- To scholars (and writers): Emacs might be a tool worth learning
* Misgivings
- I have never really been an Emacs advocate
- Emacs has a (somewhat deserved) reputation for being difficult
- Can Emacs work for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people?
- I‚Äôm a tools nerd: probably we all are
  - but many (most?) people just want to get on with their work
* On the other hand
- The forward movement on Emacs in the past few years has been
  *amazing*: thank you.
  - easily installed packages
  - testing
  - new projects with excellent UIs (magit, helm, etc.)
- Emacs comes from an alternate universe of stable,
  backwards-compatible, extensible software
  - there isn‚Äôt much like it
- Emacs is here, now, solving problems
* Emacs, some thoughts                                             :noexport:
- GNU Emacs is 30 years old!
- Emacs (generally) is 40 years old
* Scholars & programmers
- In many ways, our needs are similar
- Things that Emacs handles well:
** Long term
- some aspects of our jobs are constantly changing, but others will
  remain throughout our careers
- as we learn new things, we need to keep some things the same
- we need tools that last, tools that grow with us
** Refactoring
- Writing is all about refactoring
  - moving around text
  - rewriting
  - reorganizing
** Version control, collaboration
- All authors need version control, but they don‚Äôt have it
- Scientific writing is all about collaboration
  - But most authors still email draft versions back & forth
** Compilation
- almost every modern article, book, etc. will require some sort of
  ‚Äúcompilation process‚Äù
  - generating citations
  - generating figures, graphs, charts
  - managing cross references
  - targeting multiple platforms (e-readers, print, web)
** Coding
- an increasing part of scientific work
- computational biology
- physics
- computer science
- data science
** Cross references, linking, searching, completion
- completion
  - people out there are still typing names, references, etc. by hand!
- cross references
- finding a needle in your project haystack
- managing code bases/projects consisting of lots of files
* Reproducible research
- The idea that data & code should be published along with an article
- Bringing software engineering to science
- Solutions often similar to literate programming
- Solutions:
  - org-mode (babel)
  - knitr
  - ipython
* Packages
** org-mode
- Emacs‚Äôs secret weapon
- Written by an astronomer!
- Probably brings more scholars to Emacs than anything else
** org-mode (babel)
Org mode combined with =babel= allows users to execute code from
within an Org mode document

** org-ref + helm-bibtex
A system for managing references and citations in Org mode.

** pandoc
- not emacs, but an amazing tool
- rapidly gaining popularity among scholars
- converts from markdown, Org mode, etc. to Word, ODT, HTML, LaTeX, etc.
- supports citations, cross references, etc.
* Latex v. plain text
- Many scientists use LaTeX now, and Emacs makes a great editor
- Others are beginning to use markdown
  - pandoc has become an amazing tool
    - supports many output formats
    - supports citations (non-BibTeX)
- Emacs LaTeX support is great
- Org mode can output to LaTeX and markdown and many other formats
  - But the toolchains can be fragile and are still new
* Conclusion
- ‚Äú[W]e should do more than gently explain to students that our
  antiquated tools will eventually make them more productive. We
  should apologize for not building something better, and promise to
  try harder.‚Äù Greg Wilson,
